Run the program to create inverted index: In command line, go to src folder
type python3 invertedIndex.py [Path to json file] [Path to directory where the index will be stored]

For example, we use data/dr_seuss_lines.json as input and the output file directory is the /dr_seuss_lines/ directory,</br>
type "python3 invertedIndex.py ../data/dr_seuss_lines.json dr_seuss_lines/" in command line

If we use data/movie_plots.json as input and the output file directory is the /movie_plots/ directory</br>
type "python3 invertedIndex.py ../data/movie_plots.json movie_plots/" in command line.
