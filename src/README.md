All your code should go here and nowhere else.

Run the program to create inverted index: In command line, go to src folder
type python3 invertedIndex.py [Path do json file] [output file name]
For example, we use data/dr_seuss_lines.json as input and the output file is called index.txt
python3 invertedIndex.py ../data/dr_seuss_lines.json index.txt
